# Quadruped-Bot
This is a four legged quadruped robot dog made using 8 servos and a raspberry pi pico W. I aim to upgrade it to rapberry pi 3 or 4 in the future.
The design is inspired by stanford pupper as the pupper has a very lightweigh yet sturdy body.

The knee part is controlled by the hip yaw itself. Hip yaw movement = knee bends. And the pitch is controlled by the other motor.

This is the most affordable version I could ever think of. this also contains a solar panel for charging if used in sunlight...
