# August 30th: Lookin for inspos and figuring things out...

* There are very few videos on the youtube on making quadrupeds, got to know about some terminologies like gait(pattern of walking), inverse kinematics, center of mass etc. (Ol' Physics concepts).
* I learnt different movements/gaits. Crawl, Trot, gallop etc. Figured out that Trot is better, its both power efficient and much easier to develop.
* Researched parts on Inventory(Unfortunately couldn't find an rpi 3, this is an important part for a good quadruped inspire by spot but ill try to cover it in the $50 custom component grant)

# August 30th: midnight(cuz I can't sleep!). DESIGNING THE CAD:

* Aright the most boring part, CAD. It's boring yet important, having a structure is important.
* Need a mechanical brain to use 1 servo per leg with linkages and at the same time make it walk like a horse(dog actually crawl and trot is for dogs...)
* 12:30 ðŸ•§ AM, starting with the work...
* Okay I slept, I was thinking using 4 servos won't do it, like most of the movement wouldn't be possible so as the inventory has 7 servos, I'm gonna buy another one using the custom hardware grant. So now I have 8 servos, 2 per leg!
