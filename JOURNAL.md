# August 30th: Lookin for inspos and figuring things out...

* There are very few videos on the youtube on making quadrupeds, got to know about some terminologies like gait(pattern of walking), inverse kinematics, center of mass etc. (Ol' Physics concepts).
* I learnt different movements/gaits. Crawl, Trot, gallop etc. Figured out that Trot is better, its both power efficient and much easier to develop.
* Researched parts on Inventory(Unfortunately couldn't find an rpi 3, this is an important part for a good quadruped inspire by spot but ill try to cover it in the $50 custom component grant)

**Total time spent: 1h 30 minutes(approx)**


# August 30th: midnight(cuz I can't sleep!). THINKING OUT THE CAD:

* Aright the most boring part, CAD. It's boring yet important, having a structure is important.
* Need a mechanical brain to use 1 servo per leg with linkages and at the same time make it walk like a horse(dog actually crawl and trot is for dogs...)
* 02:30 AM, starting with the work...
* Okay I slept, I was thinking using 4 servos won't do it, like most of the movement wouldn't be possible so as the inventory has 7 servos, I'm gonna buy another one using the custom hardware grant. So now I would have 8 servos, 2 per leg.

**Total time spent: 1h**

# August 31st: research and finally making the CAD

* Okay this part was wayy difficult than expected. I am too tired to explain this part right now.
* I watched 1000s of YT videos on onshape(yeah my friend recommended onshape to me), talked to GPT for and hour(actually a bit more), scratched my head, 100s of trials and errors.
* But then after I took a break I got the perfect design, this was from a youtube video. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9J_6CKnFpHw
* I grabbed a cup of coffee, went to onshape and designed the leg(basically the femur and tibia, my bio teacher told me about these)
* then came the easiest part, mounts for servos(just a box with some holes for screws)
* then the chasis, a rectangle-ish thing with some partitions...
* Finally after a long long time witha  lot of difficulty the mighty chasis was over!!!

**Total time spent: 4h around 20 minutes**
